<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Fight Club</h3>
<p>I like this movie because it is fun and it has action mixed with psychological themes, plus great acting.</p>
<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p>I like the whole distopian future themes, and philosophical questions about reality.</p>
<h3>Nacho Libre</h3>
<p>It is one of the most stupid and racist movies I have ever seen.</p>
